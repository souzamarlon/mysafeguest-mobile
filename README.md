## :information_source: TODO
- Integration with stripe or Google Play card before registering admin account. Obs: This app is able to create the accounts but it won't execute the payment process. OR: Ask for the payment before to do the app download in Google play (My first idea was just charge the administration accounts every month.).
- Read the qr code using an IP camera. This will automatically read the QR code, it won't be necessary to read the qr code using one smartphone.
